🚀 Introducing My Menu-Driven Password Manager! 🔐

In today's world of increasing cyber threats, secure passwords are more important than ever. To help manage this, I’ve developed a Python-based Menu-Driven Password Manager that allows users to:

🔑 Generate Strong Passwords: Choose the length, include numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters. Plus, it instantly evaluates the strength of the password (Strong, Moderate, or Weak).

🔍 Retrieve Stored Passwords: Store encrypted passwords and retrieve them securely by a custom label.

🔄 Update Passwords: Easily update previously stored passwords while maintaining encryption.

🛡️ Check Password Strength: Even check the strength of an existing password before use.

Each password is securely encrypted using the Fernet encryption algorithm, and an expiry date is automatically set to help users maintain secure practices by updating passwords regularly.

Features:

Menu-driven interface for ease of use
Secure password storage with encryption
Strength evaluation for all generated passwords
I built this project using Python, focusing on security and user-friendliness. Feel free to connect if you'd like to know more or collaborate on future projects related to Python development, security, or data science.
